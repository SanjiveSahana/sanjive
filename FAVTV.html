      It's Ash Ketchum's tenth birthday, and he's ready to do what many
      10-year-olds in the Kanto region set out to do—become a Pokémon Trainer!
      Things don't go exactly the way he planned when he ends up with a Pikachu
      instead of a standard first Pokémon, and winning Gym Badges turns out to
      be much tougher than he thought. Luckily he's got former Gym Leaders Brock
      and Misty at his side, along with a bevy of new Pokémon friends, including
      Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander.

      Certainly! Young Sheldon is a delightful spin-off prequel to The Big Bang
      Theory, focusing on the childhood of the iconic character Sheldon Cooper.
      Here's a summary of Season 1: Premise: For 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper,
      growing up in East Texas isnt easy. His once-in-a-generation mind,
      capable of advanced mathematics and science, clashes with a world where
      church and football reign supreme. As Sheldon navigates life, his very
      normal family grapples with how to deal with him. His father, George, is a
      high school football coach who struggles to understand his brilliant son.
      Sheldon's mother, Mary, fiercely protects and nurtures him, while his
      older brother, Georgie, tries to be cool despite sharing classes with his
      odd younger sibling. Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, provides a dose of
      truth. The show gives us a glimpse into Sheldon's innocent, awkward, and
      hopeful journey toward the man he will become1.
