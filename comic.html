          Deidara (デイダラ) was an S-rank missing-nin from Iwagakure. During
          his time in the village, he was a member of the Explosion Corps. After
          defecting from the village, he was forced into Akatsuki and was its
          youngest member. There, Deidara was partnered with Sasori until the
          latter's death, and later with Tobi before his own death

        <p>
          Though a prodigy even by the Hyūga's standards, Neji was a member of
          the clan's branch house; no matter how skilled he became, he would
          always be in service to the Hyūga's main house, a fact that convinced
          him fate was predetermined. After experiencing Naruto Uzumaki's
          refusal to be limited by such an ideology, Neji realised his fate was
          what he chose it to be, and as a member of Team Guy he sought the
          strength necessary to make the future he wanted for his family and
          friends.

          Naruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Naruto) is
          the titular protagonist of the manga Naruto, created by Masashi
          Kishimoto. He is a ninja from the fictional Hidden Leaf Village
          (Japanese:, Hepburn: konohagakure). As a boy, Naruto is ridiculed and
          ostracized on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a malevolent
          creature that attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed away in his body.

          Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of
          Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. He later
          became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan,
          sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the
          international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity
          brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja —
          including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.
          Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
          complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in
          the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal
          shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end
