        >
        is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios
        and published by Bethesda Softworks.[2] In the game, the player +
        character joins a group of space explorers who must venture to various
        corners of the galaxy to acquire mysterious artifacts. The game features
        an open world in the form of an area within the Milky Way galaxy,
        containing both fictional and non-fictional planetary systems. Starfield
        takes place in a space-themed setting, and is the first new intellectual
        property developed by Bethesda in 25 years.[3] It was described by
        director Todd Howard as "Skyrim in space". Like Bethesda's previous
        games, it was powered by the Creation Engine, though it was heavily
        modified to accommodate the game's procedural generation system. Active
        development of the game started following the release of Fallout 4 in
        2015.

        represents the standalone version of what Greene believes is the "final
        version" of the battle royale concept, incorporating the elements he had
        designed in previous iterations.[6][33] Faster development was possible
        with the game engine Unreal Engine 4, compared with ARMA and H1Z1, which
        were built with proprietary game engines. Greene acknowledged that
        implementing the size of the maps in PUBG has been one of the challenges
        with working with Unreal, which was not designed with such maps in
        mind.[6][12] The game was designed as a mix between the realistic
        simulation of ARMA 3 and the arcade-like action focus and player
        accessibility of H1Z1.[5] To prevent in-game cheating, the game uses
        BattlEye anti-cheating software, which had permanently banned over 13
        million players by October 2018.[34][35] BattlEye indicated that 99% of
        all cheating software for the game was developed in China.[36]

        is a Japanese fantasy tactical role-playing game franchise developed by
        Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. First produced and
        published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990, the series
        currently consists of seventeen core entries and five spinoffs. The core
        gameplay revolves around discrete battles between the player's team of
        characters and enemy non-player characters across grid-based maps. The
        player and enemy each take turns moving their characters across the map
        and having them perform combat-based actions. The games also feature a
        story and characters similar to traditional role-playing video games,
        and occasionally social simulation aspects as well. A notable aspect of
        gameplay is the permanent death of characters in battle, rendering them
        unusable upon being defeated, although this aspect of the game can be
        turned off starting from Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem onwards.
        The series' title refers to the "Fire Emblem", a recurring element
        usually portrayed as a royal weapon or shield representing the power of
        war and dragons. The development of the first game began as a dōjin
        project by Shouzou Kaga and three other developers, and its success
        prompted the development of further games in the series. Kaga headed the
        development of each entry until the release of Thracia 776, when he left
        Intelligent Systems. He went on to found his own game studio, Tirnanog,
        who developed Tear Ring Saga.

        to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with
        traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox">Roblox</a>
        (/'roʊblɒks/ ROH-bloks) is an online game platform and game
        creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to
        program and play games created by themselves or other users. Created by
        David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the
        platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the
        programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was
        relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to
        grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been
        accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.[10][11] Roblox is free to play,
        with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called
        Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active
        users, including more than half of all American children under
        16.[12][13] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from
        critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation, microtransactions,
        and allegations of exploitative practices toward children

         is a 3D survival sandbox game developed and published by
        Mojang, spanning multiple platforms. It was originally created by the
        independent video game designer Markus Persson in 2009, before giving
        the development to Jens Bergensten in 2011. The game has no specific
        goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in
        choosing how to play the game.[1] Gameplay is in the first-person
        perspective,[2] with the core gameplay modes being survival, in which
        players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health
        (optionally with a "hardcore" limit, which deletes the world after the
        player dies); and creative, in which players have unlimited resources,
        no hunger and are able to fly. The game world is composed of
        voxels—cubes, commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials,
        such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava, which are
        arranged in a 3-dimensional grid. Gameplay revolves around picking up
        and placing these objects as the player pleases, while being able to
        move freely around the world.[3]
