        Pickleball is a racket or paddle sport in which two players (singles) or
        four players (doubles) use a paddle to hit a perforated, hollow plastic
        ball over a 34-inch-high (0.86 m) net until one side is unable to return
        the ball or commits a rule infraction. Pickleball is played indoors and
        outdoors. It was invented in 1965 as a children's backyard game in the
        United States, on Bainbridge Island in Washington state. In 2022,
        pickleball was named the official state sport of Washington.[2] Aspects
        of the sport resemble tennis and table tennis, but pickleball has
        specific rules, paddles and court dimensions. The court is 44 feet
        (13.4m) long and 20 feet (6.1m) wide, and the paddle is larger than the
        one used in table tennis. The hard plastic ball used in pickleball
        produces less bounce than tennis balls. On each side of the net is a
        7-foot area (2.1 m) known as the non-volley zone (or the kitchen); a
        player standing therein may not strike the ball until it has bounced.
        The rules specify side out scoring, where only the server side can score
        a point. The limited bounce, non-volley zones, and underhanded stroke,
        with which all serves are made, combined with hard drive shots and
        overhead smash shots, give the game a dynamic pace.

        In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is
        a utility bicycle. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting
        the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds.
        Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards,
        pannier racks and lights, which extends their usefulness on a daily
        basis. Since the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation,
        various companies have developed methods of carrying anything from the
        weekly shop to children on bicycles. Certain countries rely heavily on
        bicycles and their culture has developed around the bicycle as a primary
        form of transport. In Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands have the most
        bicycles per capita and most often use bicycles for everyday
        transport.[7][8] Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a
        shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride
        slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the
        rider to bend forward more, making use of stronger muscles (particularly
        the gluteus maximus) and reducing air resistance at high speed. Road
        bikes are designed for speed and efficiency on paved roads. They are
        characterized by their lightweight frames, skinny tires, drop
        handlebars, and narrow saddles. Road bikes are ideal for racing,
        long-distance riding, and fitness training.

        Nintendo was founded in 1889 as Nintendo Koppai[c] by craftsman Fusajiro
        Yamauchi and originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. After
        venturing into various lines of business during the 1960s and acquiring
        a legal status as a public company, Nintendo distributed its first
        console, the Color TV-Game, in 1977. It gained international recognition
        with the release of Donkey Kong in 1981 and the Nintendo Entertainment
        System and Super Mario Bros. in 1985.

      <p>The Legend of Zelda[a] is an action-adventure game franchise created by
      the Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is
      primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable
      installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Flagship, Vanpool,
      and Grezzo. Its gameplay incorporates action-adventure and elements of
      action RPG games. The series centers on the various incarnations of Link,
      a courageous young man of the elf-like Hylian race, and Princess Zelda, a
      magical princess within the bloodline of the goddess Hylia, as they fight
      to save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned
      demon king, who is the principal antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to
      use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that
      created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered
      together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its user desires;
      however, if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the
      three virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to touch the
      Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three people
      whose hearts embody the required virtue.</p>

        Erin Hunter is a collective pseudonym used by the authors Victoria
        Holmes, Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Clarissa Hutton, Inbali Iserles, Tui
        T. Sutherland, and Rosie Best in the writing of several juvenile fantasy
        novel series which focus on animals and their adventures. Notable works
        include the Warriors, Seekers, Survivors, Bravelands, and Bamboo Kingdom
        book series.[1] For each book, Holmes creates the plot and the others
        take turns writing the books.[2] Dan Jolley, though not an official Erin
        Hunter author, also writes the stories for manga published under the
        Hunter name.[3] James L. Barry, Bettina M. Kurkoski, and Don Hudson are
        included under the pseudonym as the illustrators of the Warriors mangas.
        Natalie Riess and Sara Goetter are also included as the illustrators of
        the upcoming graphic novel adaptation of The Prophecies Begin.[4]
